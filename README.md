# Welcome to my GitHub profile — I'm Sanyukta Tuti

Software Engineer and AI Researcher specializing in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Data Systems.  
I enjoy building intelligent systems that combine scalable engineering with applied research — from real-time data platforms to autonomous navigation and advanced AI models.  
Currently exploring intersections of LLMs, computer vision, and distributed systems.

## Featured Projects
- **[Personal-AI-Twin](https://github.com/Sanyuktatuti/Personal-AI-Twin)** – End-to-end LLM pipeline that scrapes posts, streams through MongoDB CDC → RabbitMQ → Bytewax, embeds into Qdrant, fine-tunes an 8B model (LoRA/QLoRA) on AWS SageMaker, and deploys a RAG API with Gradio UI.
- **[Candidate-Recommendation-Engine](https://github.com/Sanyuktatuti/Candidate-Recommendation-Engine)** – Candidate recommender that ranks resumes against job descriptions using embeddings + cosine similarity, generating concise AI fit summaries.
- **[airspace-congestion-monitoring](https://github.com/Sanyuktatuti/airspace-congestion-monitoring)** – Real-time flight tracking and congestion analysis platform with Kafka, Spark Structured Streaming, and Streamlit; integrates OpenSky API, risk scoring, and spatial grid analytics.
- **[Jailbreaking-Deep-Models](https://github.com/Sanyuktatuti/Jailbreaking-Deep-Models)** – Adversarial attack experiments on ImageNet classifiers (ResNet-34, DenseNet-121); implements FGSM and PGD L∞ attacks with evaluation scripts and notebooks.
- **[NYU_research_visualization](https://github.com/Sanyuktatuti/NYU_research_visualization)** – Interactive data visualization of NYU faculty research using D3.js and Python, enabling exploration of institutional collaborations and research output.
